## Introduction

Inspired by my engagement with the AgML community's "Regional Crop Yield Forecasting" challenge, I created a Python library designed to set benchmarks for Machine Learning (ML) models. The library presents an efficient workflow for extracting statistical information from big remote sensing and climate datasets. Currently, The library presents two workflows. First, for dealing with GeoTIFF files, as the main workflow of EarthStat. In addition, it presents a unique workflow for AgERA5 datasets, which gives the user the power to download a huge amount of different variables using CDS API, extended to extract and aggregate all downloaded data. EarthStat's workflows provide multiprocessing and GPU for parallel computation as an option. This library is particularly suited for creating statistical information datasets for ML models or for environmental analyses and monitoring.

## EarthStat Main Workflow Features

EarthStat revolutionizes the extraction of statistical information from geographic data, offering a seamless workflow for effective data management:

- **Data Initialization & Geo-metadata Readability:** Streamlines the incorporation of datasets into EarthStat workflow, and getting insights of vital geo-metadata for data (Raster, Mask, Shapefile).

- **netCDF Conversion:** Seamlessly integrates netCDF files into the workflow, converting them effortlessly into GeoTIFF format.

- **Data Compatibility Assurance:** Simplifies ensuring data compatibility, swiftly identifying and addressing geo data discrepancies among initialized data (Raster, Mask, Shapefile).

- **Automated Resolution of Compatibility Issues:** EarthStat resolves compatibility concerns, employing automatic resampling or reprojecting techniques for masks, and appropriate projection adjustments for shapefiles.

- **Targeted Region Selection:** Easily filter the shapefile to the targeted region.

- **Data Clipping:** Allows for clip raster data to specific shapefile boundaries.

- **Advanced Statistical Data Extraction:** Offers a variety of statistical aggregation methods.

- **Efficient Parallel Processing:** Leverages the power of multiprocessing, significantly accelerating data processing across extensive datasets for quicker, more efficient computation.

## EarthStat Main Workflow Features
- **Unlimited AgERA5 Data Downloads**: The EarthStat workflow enables users to bypass the limitations of the CDS server, allowing for the download of any quantity of data for the required variables.
- **Fully Automated**: This library is entirely automated and does not require any prior Python knowledge. Users simply need to select the variables for download and aggregation, specify the start and end years to determine the data volume, and define the shapefile containing the geometry objects.
- **Parallel Computation**: EarthStat workflow intelligently detects GPU availability to shift aggregation processes for parallel computation on the GPU. It also offers users the option to leverage available CPU cores for multiprocessing (Parallel Execution), enhancing I/O-bound tasks.
- **Aggregated Data as CSV**: Ultimately, the workflow provides users with a neatly organized CSV file, compiling all downloaded and aggregated variables.
